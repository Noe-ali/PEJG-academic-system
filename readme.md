# Academic Schedule System

This project is a simple academic schedule system that allows students to check for course schedules, add or modify courses, and generate their own schedule based on the courses' NRCs. It also checks for any schedule conflicts and indicates if the student is enrolled in special programs like social service or professional internships.
